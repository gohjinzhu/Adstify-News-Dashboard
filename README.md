# My Vite Project

This project is built using Vite, a fast and lightweight development build tool for modern web applications.


## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/gohjinzhu/news-dashboard.git
   cd your-vite-project
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the development server:
   ```
   npm run dev
   ```

   The application will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Configuration

The development server runs on port 3000 by default. If you need to change this, you can modify the `vite.config.js` file:

```javascript
export default defineConfig({
  // ... other config options
  server: {
    port: 3000
  }
})
```
